Wine Quality Analysis â€“ Red Wine Dataset
Welcome to my portfolio project on red wine quality analysis! This project explores the "winequality-red.csv" dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and insightful visualizations to better understand the factors that influence wine quality.

**Project Overview
**
This project aims to:

Import, clean, and explore the red wine quality dataset.

Visualize relationships between key chemical properties and wine quality.

Answer analytical questions about the dataset using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib).

**Dataset**

The dataset used is "winequality-red.csv", which contains various physicochemical properties of red wine samples, along with their quality ratings.

**Project Steps
**
Data Import & Structure Exploration

Load the dataset and inspect its structure (number of rows, columns, and data types).

Data Cleaning

Remove duplicate rows and handle missing values to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

Visualize the distribution of volatile acidity by wine quality.

Visualize the distribution of alcohol content by wine quality.

Explore the relationship between volatile acidity and alcohol content.

Analyze the relationship between alcohol content and wine quality.

**Analytical Questions
**
1- What is the average volatile acidity of high-quality wines?

2- How does alcohol content relate to wine quality?

3 - Is there a relationship between volatile acidity and alcohol content?

4 - Is there a relationship between volatile acidity and wine quality?

**Technologies Used
**
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook
